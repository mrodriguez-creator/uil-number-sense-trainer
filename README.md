## 🎓 For Students

### Quick Start
1. **Choose a mode:**
   - New to Number Sense? Start with **Drill Mode** on basic topics
   - Preparing for a test? Use **Timed Rounds** at 5:00 and work toward 2:30
   - Testing your skills? Try the **Full 80-Problem Simulation**

2. **Focus on your weak areas:**
   - After each session, check the **"Needs Work"** callout
   - Drill those specific topics until you're fast and accurate

3. **Track your progress:**
   - Watch your **seconds-per-problem** decrease over time
   - Aim for sub-10-second average on Problems 1-20

### Pro Tips
- **Real UIL pacing:** Problems 1-20 should take ~2:30 minutes (7.5 sec/problem)
- **Don't skip ahead:** Master the basics (1-20) before worrying about advanced problems
- **Use hints wisely:** In drill mode, wrong answers show hints — study them!
- **Starred problems:** Accept ±5% tolerance for approximations (save time, don't overthink)
